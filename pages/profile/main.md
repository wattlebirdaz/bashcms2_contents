## About me

Hi, I am Riki.
Currently an junior (3rd year) undergraduate at The University of Tokyo, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.


## My interest

### Programming

- erlang
```erlang
io:format("I use erlang for building distirbuted systems")
```
- python3 
```python
print("I use python for machine learning based projects")
```
- c/c++
```cpp
cout << "I use c++ for competitive programming" << endl;
```

### Statistics

$$ P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \dfrac{P(B|A)P(A)}{\sum_{A' \in \mathcal{A}} P(B|A') P(A')}$$
