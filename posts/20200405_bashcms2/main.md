# A website written in bash

This website is based on a bash content management system, bashcms.
The implementation of this system is referenced from the book "シェルスクリプト高速開発手法入門改訂2版" written by Ryuichi Ueda.

[シェルスクリプト高速開発手法入門改訂2版]( https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4048930699/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4)

Although it says, "フルスクラッチから1日でCMSを作る" (developing a CMS from scratch in ONE DAY) in the title, it took me a month to go through the book.

Before reading this book, I had a little averison towards using shell script (especially with sed and awk), but now I feel very comfortable using them.

I will try to write down the technical details of what I learned from the book on this blog soon.

Highly recommend reading this book if you are new to shell script and don't know where to start.
