## A website written in bash

This website is based on bash content management system, bashcms.
The implementation of this system is referenced from the book "シェルスクリプト高速開発手法入門改訂2版" written by Ryuichi Ueda.

Although it says, "フルスクラッチから1日でCMSを作る" (developing a CMS in bash from scratch in ONE DAY) in the title, it took me a month to go through the book.

Before reading this book, I had a little averison towards using shell script (especially with sed and awk), but now I feel very comfortable using them.

Highly recommend reading this book if you are new to shell script and don't know where to start.
